## About

I'm Yimin Ding, and you can call me Minnie. I'm an epi student now studying in cardiovascular and clinical track. I spent my undergraduate year in Tulane University in New Orleans, where a place mixed with features such as hurricane, classics, romance, and oysters lol. I didn't raise my interest in programming until my last semester in Tulane, while a mandatory course requirement is needed for my graduation. Having been trying to escape from maths for 4 years, such experience diverted my schedule for future life, and made up the decision of exploring in this field in the future. I love swimming, and playing the piano. Reading is also what I am fond of doing in my spare time. I have studied as a liberal arts student in my past time, and have never realized that I would come into contact with the field of computing, nor did I think I would develop a strong interest in it.
